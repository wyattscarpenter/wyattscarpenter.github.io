# Gameography

## Games

* Unnamed physical object game (involving a stuffed-animal pumpkin, paper bags, sticks, a paper crown, etc. Untested, probably bad)
* Unnamed pen and paper game about setting things on fire.
* Unnamed labyrinth board game (cardboard, play-doh)
* Hypothetical Towers (physical card game made of spare cards from other trading card games)
* Wyatt Puzzle (physical jigsaw puzzle made with a piece of woods and a bandsaw)
* A small series of inchoate pen-and-paper tabletop roleplaying systems often called "Angel Eyes" (due to the term for rolling 2 sixes I made up and thought was cool). Occasionally these involved flipping coins to generate arbitrary random numbers.
* I was of some influence on the Actlite pnp trpg (forthcoming? possibly abandoned)
* Indie roguelite solitaire (forthcoming)
