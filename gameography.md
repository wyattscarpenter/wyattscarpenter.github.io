# Gameography

This listing aims to be comprehensive, which is inconvenient for you, the reader, I'm sure.

## Games

* Unnamed physical object game (involving a stuffed-animal pumpkin, paper bags, sticks, a paper crown, etc. Untested, probably bad)
* Unnamed pen and paper game about setting things on fire.
* Unnamed labyrinth board game (cardboard, play-doh)
* Hypothetical Towers (physical card game made of spare cards from other trading card games)
* Wyatt Puzzle (physical jigsaw puzzle made with a piece of woods and a bandsaw)
* A small series of inchoate pen-and-paper tabletop roleplaying systems often called "Angel Eyes" (due to the term for rolling 2 sixes I made up and thought was cool). Occasionally these involved flipping coins to generate arbitrary random numbers.
* Unnamed expandable rules game (untested and unimplemented; contained entirely in this footnote:[^1])
* I was of some influence on the Actlite pnp trpg (forthcoming? possibly abandoned)
* Indie roguelite solitaire (forthcoming)

[^1]: While riffing today, I tried to come up with an idea for one of these board games that could start very simple and then be expanded with more rules into a more complex game, thereby destroying the failure mode where you have to read the seven page document before you can start playing the game.\
  I think I did it too:\
The base game consists of rolling a bunch of d6's, and if you get a one you draw one card and if you get a two you draw two cards, so you draw the sum of that in your role of four dice, and then you take those cards and you try to find matches in them like in go fish.\
Later rounds add a special deck for rolling threes, and fours, and these are cards you can play to fuck with your opponents, and if you roll a six you get an extra die or can remove an opponent's die, fives do something like those two, then maybe at some point a board or tile placing is added.
